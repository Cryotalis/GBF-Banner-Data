# GBF-Banner-Data
Stores banner data for Granblue Fantasy. Banners are categorized by the year and month in which they started.

## Schema
> [!NOTE]
> - Banner Data JSON files contain an object with a bannerInfo (object) property and an items (array) property.
> - Properties containing `rate1` in their name refer to draw rates for single draws or the first 9 draws of a 10-Part Draw.
> - Properties containing `rate2` in their name refer to draw rates for the last draw of a 10-Part Draw (which excludes R items and guarantees an SR or better).

#### :question: Banner images which rely on the banner key:
- Background: [https://prd-game-a-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/`key`/header/bg.jpg](https://prd-game-a-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/8nkt9t7y/header/bg.jpg)
- Banner Info Text: [https://prd-game-a-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/`key`/header/logo.png](https://prd-game-a-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/8nkt9t7y/header/logo.png)
    - For banners [like these](https://game.granbluefantasy.jp/#news/detail/7087/2/1/1) which feature a different element on rate up each day, the banner key will stay the same between all 6 banners, but _`element` needs to be added to the link after **logo** and before **.png** to get the info text for each element's banner.
    - Example: https://prd-game-a-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/1a2ro6cj/header/logo_fire.png
- Fate Episodes promotional image for featured characters: [https://prd-game-a1-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/`key`/feature/index/`id + 1`_`key`.jpg](https://prd-game-a1-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/8nkt9t7y/feature/index/206881_8nkt9t7y.jpg)
    - `id + 1` is the banner ID + 1 (e.g. if banner ID is 100000, the value here should be 100001)
    - Note that there is an underscore between the `id + 1` and the `key`.
    - This image is infrequently updated and can show characters that were featured in the past and not featured on the current banner
- Featured summon images: [https://prd-game-a1-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/`key`/feature/index/`id`.jpg](https://prd-game-a1-granbluefantasy.akamaized.net/assets_en/img/sp/gacha/8nkt9t7y/feature/index/2040423000.jpg)
    - `id` is the summon's ID. Does not work with items that are not summons.

### directory
The directory is an array of bannerInfo objects ONLY, to make it easier to find a banner. These bannerInfo objects include an additional `path` (string) property which provides the filepath to the banner data file.
